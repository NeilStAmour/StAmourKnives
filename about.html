            <p>
                For over 30 years, Murray St. Amour has been handcrafting knives shaped by experience.
                A lifelong hunter and angler, his connection to Ontario’s forests and waterways runs
                deep — and it shows in every knife he builds: practical, enduring, and made to be trusted.
                <br><br>
                Based in Pembroke, Ontario, each blade is handcrafted from premium steel and comes with a
                custom-fitted leather sheath. Every pairing is backed by a lifetime guarantee for
                working use, not storage. His inventory is ever-evolving, guided by available materials and
                requests from collectors and outdoorsmen alike.

                        <h4>154CM</h4>
                        <p>A classic, time-tested stainless steel known for its balance of toughness, edge
                            retention, corrosion resistance, and flexibility. It sharpens easily and performs 
                            reliably in both the field and the kitchen — a versatile choice trusted by 
                            professionals for decades.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>CPM-154</h4>
                        <p>A premium version of 154CM made through powder metallurgy. It offers a finer grain
                            structure, which means improved edge stability, better polish, and slightly longer
                            edge retention. A refined choice for those who value performance with a touch of
                            elegance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>S30V</h4>
                        <p>A high-performance stainless steel built for edge retention and wear resistance. 
                            Its fine grain structure and vanadium carbides give it long-lasting sharpness, 
                            making it ideal for demanding cutting tasks. The trade-off for that edge-holding 
                            strength is reduced flexibility and slightly more effort when sharpening compared 
                            to softer steels. S30V is an excellent choice if you need a knife that stays 
                            sharp through extended hard use without regular touch-ups.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>S90V</h4>
                        <p>An ultra-high-performance stainless steel engineered for maximum edge retention. 
                            With a very high vanadium content and dense carbide structure, S90V holds a 
                            razor-sharp edge far longer than most steels on the market. In exchange, it 
                            offers very little flexibility and can be challenging to sharpen without the 
                            right tools and experience. This is a steel for users who demand top-tier 
                            cutting performance and are prepared to maintain it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>ATS‑34</h4>
                        <p>A Japanese-made stainless steel that's virtually identical to 154CM in both 
                            composition and performance. I use it when availability or cost makes it 
                            the better option. If you’ve used a 154CM blade before, expect the same 
                            toughness, edge retention, and ease of maintenance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>Damascus</h4>
                        <p>Visually striking with its flowing patterns, Damascus steel combines art and
                            function. Made by layering and forging multiple steels, it offers a blend of
                            toughness and character. While edge performance does not match the more robust 
                            steels, each blade is truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

                        <h4>Hardwoods</h4>
                        <p>Hardwood handles are prized for their natural beauty, durability, and warmth in
                            the hand. Dense species like ironwood, cocobolo, and maple burl offer both
                            striking grain patterns and excellent wear resistance. Wood develops a rich
                            patina over time and tends to feel more “alive” than synthetics. These handles
                            are a favorite for collectors and outdoorsmen who appreciate classic
                            craftsmanship and a connection to natural materials.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>Synthetics</h4>
                        <p>Modern synthetic materials like G10, Micarta, and carbon fiber are chosen for
                            their ruggedness and reliability. They are virtually resistant to moisture,
                            temperature changes, and impact—making them ideal for heavy-use knives in
                            extreme environments. Synthetics are often textured for grip and require
                            virtually no maintenance. They are a top choice for users who prioritize
                            function over form, or who need a tool that performs under pressure in any
                            condition.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="material-item">
                        <h4>Antler & Bone</h4>
                        <p>These traditional materials offer organic variation and a sense of heritage.
                            Deer or elk antler is dense and slightly textured, offering a natural grip.
                            Buffalo horn and bone are often polished smooth and can be dyed or
                            scrimshawed for custom work. While not as stable as synthetics or some
                            hardwoods, their natural feel and appearance make them popular with hunters
                            and collectors seeking timeless aesthetics and rustic character.</p>

                        <h4>Ivory</h4>
                        <p>Ivory is a rare and highly prized handle material, valued for its smooth
                            finish, distinctive grain, and timeless visual appeal. Sourced both legally and
                            ethically, mammoth and walrus ivory lend a sense of history and refinement
                            to any blade. While not intended for hard use, ivory is ideal for collectors
                            and those seeking an heirloom-quality knife with unmatched character.</p>

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <section id="faq">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>How do I order a knife?</h4>
            <p>Send me an email describing what you're looking for—whether it's a working knife, a kitchen
                blade, or something more specific. Based on your description, I’ll respond with any finished
                knives I have on hand that match your needs, or in-progress builds that can be completed to
                suit your preferences. If nothing fits, we can discuss options for a custom build. </p>
            <h4>Can I get a custom knife?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely. The custom process usually starts by choosing a steel and blade shape based on
                how you intend to use the knife. I’m happy to provide suggestions tailored to your needs
                and intended purpose. After that, options and examples of finished work are available to
                help you select the perfect handle material. Whether you have a clear idea or just a
                general direction, I’ll guide you step-by-step to create a knife that fits your hand,
                style, and requirements perfectly.</p>
            <h4>How much do your knives cost?</h4>
            <p>Pricing depends on materials, design, and finish. Most builds range between $250 and
                $500, though simpler or smaller knives may come in below that, and more elaborate pieces may go
                higher. I’m always up front about costs once we’ve outlined the design. If you’re working with
                a specific budget, let me know—I can often tailor something within range.</p>
            <h4>How does payment work?</h4>
            <p>Finished knives have a set price. For custom work, the price is agreed upon before work begins. 
                Payment in full is required before the knife is shipped. Shipping costs are extra. Pickup is 
                available at my shop or at regional shows I attend, by prior arrangement. Accepted payment 
                methods are cash, e-transfer, and international money order.</p>
            <h4>When will I get my knife?</h4>
            <p>Finished knives typically ship within one to two weeks. Custom orders usually take between 
                six and twelve months, depending on my current schedule. Please keep this timeline in mind 
                when placing an order—these knives are made with care, and the process takes time.</p>
            <h4>Is there any warranty?</h4>
            <p>Every knife is guaranteed for life under standard use. If a blade or material fails, it
                will be repaired or replaced. These knives are built to last—and with proper care,
                they’ll outlive you. Natural materials like wood or bone will shift and age over time, 
                adding character and uniqueness to each piece</p>
            <p>As part of that commitment, I also offer free lifetime sharpening. Just  cover the cost 
                of shipping, or arrange a pickup/drop-off if you're local, and I’ll restore  your edge 
                at no charge.</p>
            <h4>How do I care for my knife?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hand wash only</strong> – Never put knives in the dishwasher; clean with warm 
                    water and mild soap, then dry immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Store safely</strong> – Use a knife block or magnetic strip to avoid dulling 
                    or damage your knives. Never store your knives wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it sharp</strong> – These knives are made from high-performance steel 
                    and can be more challenging to sharpen than factory blades. If you’re not confident 
                    in your sharpening skills, I recommend sending them back to me for a proper 
                    resharpening. For those comfortable doing it themselves, I suggest using a diamond 
                    sharpener for best results.</li>
                <li><strong>Wood oils</strong> – Treat wood, ivory, bone, antler, and horn 
                    handles with a mineral based oil once or twice a year to preserve and prevent drying 
                    or cracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Use proper surfaces</strong> – Always cut on wood or plastic boards; avoid 
                    glass, stone, or metal.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid misuse</strong> – Don’t pry, twist, or chop bone or frozen food unless 
                    the knife is made for it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Where do you ship to?</h4>
            <p>I regularly ship across Canada and the U.S., with select international shipping available on 
                request. If you're overseas, let me know and we can consider available options. Tracking 
                numbers can be provided on request.</p>
            <h4>Where can I see your knives in person?</h4>
            <p>I regularly attend the <a href="https://torontoknifeshow.ca/">Toronto Knife Show</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.greatlakescustomknifeshow.com/">Great Lakes Custom Knife Show</a>, 
                and the Renfrew Gun & Hunting Show, along with other regional events throughout the year. 
                If you're local, pickups or private viewings may be available by appointment.</p>
